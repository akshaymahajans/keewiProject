Dashboard for energy analytics

Photos for this project are Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 - I could only get one chart created with the data, as most of my time was spent understanding the UI template and planning out what I wanted to do. I wanted to map  the differences between 522 and 523's kWh consumption, and track the difference. I also wanted to create a graph that shows 522's energy bill - by creating a function that takes in the KW use and kWh use and multiplies them with rate constants.
